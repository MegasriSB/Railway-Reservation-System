The Railway Reservation System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the registration, booking, and cancellation processes for train reservations. The system provides a user-friendly interface for users to register, book tickets, and cancel reservations efficiently. The registration process allows users to create an account by providing their personal details, including name, email, password, and contact information. Once registered, users can proceed to the booking process. The booking interface enables users to select their desired origin, destination, date, and number of passengers. The system validates the input, checks seat availability, calculates fares, and generates a unique booking reference number. The booking details are stored in the database, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. In the event of a cancellation, users can access the cancellation feature by providing the relevant booking reference number or required information. The system validates the cancellation request, verifies the booking, and updates the database accordingly. Seat availability is adjusted, and associated records are modified to reflect the cancellation status. The Railway Reservation System streamlines the reservation process, offering a convenient and efficient solution for users to register, book tickets, and cancel reservations.
